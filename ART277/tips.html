        </h3>

         <p>
          As restrictions and mask mandates are dropped around the county, people who are fully 
          vaccinated might be feeling the return-to-normal fantasy. But Dr. Cardona warns that now still

            “‘Fully vaccinated’ means that you completed a COVID-19 
            vaccine series as recommended for the best protection against 
            severe complications such as hospitalizations and/or death. No 
            vaccine offers 100% protection against illness, yet it does give 
            you a better chance to fight off the infectious consequences of 
            being exposed to the SARS-CoV2 virus.”

        <h3 class="highlight">
          Can fully vaccinated people still transmit the  virus to 
          others, including other vaccinated people?
        </h3>

        <p>
          While it is possible, Dr. Cardona says that the ability to transmit COVID-19 may occur at a lower 
          rate. She adds that this could also be a reality for people who don’t have a good immune 
          response to vaccines.
        </p>

        <p>
          “The elderly, those with immune or chronic health conditions or those with underlying health 
          disorders may not have the best protective response to vaccines, such as the COVID-19 vaccines. 
          We are still collecting data and doing ongoing research about the vaccine responses in these 
          vulnerable populations.”
